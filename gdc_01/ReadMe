Idea 1: Determine whether slow and fast gamma support distinct directed network architecture:
Dataset : LFP(Monkey dataset) #(Most probably)
Toolbox: MATLAB: FieldTrip + Chronux
  Step 1:Preprocessing data to reduce noise.
  Step 2:Time frequency decomposition:
    Separate band-limited time series for slow (30-50 Hz) and fast gamma(60-100 Hz)
  Step 3: Get burst onset times per electrode 
    (either from data if already calculated or use custom hilbert transform)
  Step 4:Compute GC across entire trial
    Use MATLAB fieldtrip toolbox and functions such as ft_mvaranalysis,ft_freqanalysis (method = 'mvar')
    ft_connectivityanalysis (granger) to get the GC (frequency,source,matrix)
  Step 5: Get the graph adjacency matrix
    Compute
    SlowGC(i,j) = ∫ GC(f,i,j) df over 30–50 Hz
    FastGC(i,j) = ∫ GC(f,i,j) df over 60–100 Hz.
    These may become our graph adjacency matrices.
  Step 6: Analyse these matrices to compare network metrics.
    
Idea 2: Test whether slow gamma phase entrains fast gamma phase:
Dataset : EEG dataset
Toolbox: Fieldtrip (mostly)
  Step 1: Preprocessing Data to reduce noise.
  Step 2: Define Regions of Interest.
    #Like Frontal-Temporal-Occiptical like in the list.
  Step 3: Spectral decomposition
    #To get the band specific time
   Step 4:
    For each burst extract window[-200 ms,+300ms] and separate into slow and fast burst
  Step 5: Make directed GC matrix per band.
    Use fieldtrip analysis with mvar to fit mvar model,compute spectral GC
