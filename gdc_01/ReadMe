Idea 1: Determine whether slow and fast gamma support distinct directed network architecture:
Dataset : LFP(Monkey dataset) #(Most probably)
Toolbox: MATLAB: FieldTrip + Chronux
  Step 1:Preprocessing data to reduce noise.
  Step 2:Time frequency decomposition:
    Separate band-limited time series for slow (30-50 Hz) and fast gamma(60-100 Hz)
  Step 3: Get burst onset times per electrode 
    (either from data if already calculated or use custom hilbert transform)
  Step 4:
Idea 2: Test whether slow gamma phase entrains fast gamma phase:

   Step 4:
    For each burst extract window[-200 ms,+300ms] and separate into slow and fast burst
  Step 5: Make directed GC matrix per band.
    Use fieldtrip analysis with mvar to fit mvar model,compute spectral GC
