Aim 01: Determine whether slow and fast gamma support distinct directed network architecture -
Dataset : LFP(Monkey dataset)
Toolbox: MATLAB: FieldTrip + Chronux

  Step 1: Preprocessing data to reduce noise (if raw data is provided).
  Step 2: Time frequency decomposition (Spectral Analysis):
          Separate band-limited time series for slow (30-50 Hz) and fast gamma(60-100 Hz)
  Step 3: Get burst onset times per electrode 
          (either from data if already calculated or use custom hilbert transform)
  Step 4: Compute GC across entire trial
          Use MATLAB fieldtrip toolbox and functions such as ft_mvaranalysis,ft_freqanalysis (method = 'mvar')
          ft_connectivityanalysis (granger) to get the GC (frequency,source,matrix)
  Step 5: Get the graph adjacency matrix
          Compute
          SlowGC(i,j) = ∫ GC(f,i,j) df over 30–50 Hz
          FastGC(i,j) = ∫ GC(f,i,j) df over 60–100 Hz.
          These may become our graph adjacency matrices.
  Step 6: Analyse these matrices to compare network metrics.
    
Aim 02: Test whether slow gamma phase entrains fast gamma phase -
Dataset : LFP (monkey dataset)  
Toolbox: Fieldtrip + Chronux

  Step 1: Preprocessing Data to reduce noise (if raw data is provided).
  Step 2: Time frequency decomposition (Spectral Analysis):
          Separate band-limited time series for slow (30-50 Hz) and fast gamma(60-100 Hz)
  Step 3: Get burst onset times per electrode 
          (either from data if already calculated or use custom hilbert transform)
  Step 4: Calculate Phase Slope Index (PSI) to further compute Cross Frequency Directionality (CFD) (using Mutli Taper Approach)
  Step 5: Calculate Cross Frequency Coupling (CFC) values between the 2 band ranges
  Step 6: Analyze the CFC and CFD by plotting heatmaps 
  Step 7: Perform (repeated measures) rmANOVA (or other appropriate statistical tests) comparing regions of interest.
